    <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>LexisOne helps users learn and practise languages through reading. The App allows users to view side-by-side text in their native and target languages, listen to AI-generated audio, and receive contextual explanations of words and phrases (‚ÄúFocuses‚Äù).</p>

    <h2>2. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>OpenAI</strong> technology to generate, simplify, and translate reading materials (‚ÄúLenses‚Äù) and to provide word or phrase explanations. While we aim for high-quality and educational results, the accuracy and suitability of AI-generated content cannot be guaranteed. AI-generated text or audio may include grammatical errors, inaccuracies, or unnatural phrasing.</p>

    <h2>3. Audio Generation</h2>
    <p>The read-aloud feature uses AI text-to-speech. Pronunciation and tone may vary depending on the AI system and language. Audio output is intended for learning support only and should not be considered perfect native pronunciation.</p>

    <h2>4. Lens Creation and Credits</h2>
    <p>LexisOne is free to download. Certain features require Lens Credits, available as in-app purchases. Lens Credits allow users to create new Lenses and use AI Focuses within them. If a Lens fails to generate correctly, users may request a refund by contacting <a href="mailto:info@code-82.com">info@code-82.com</a>. Otherwise, purchases are non-refundable once used.</p>

    <h2>5. Account and Data</h2>
    <p>Accounts are created using email and password via Firebase Authentication. We store only limited data in Firestore: your Lens allowance, native language, learning language, and CEFR level. We do not store or log AI input or output text.</p>

    <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You agree to use LexisOne for lawful, educational purposes only. You must not upload, share, or use the App in any way that infringes on others‚Äô rights or violates applicable laws. LexisOne provides learning support only and should not be relied upon for certified translation or linguistic accuracy.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All design, branding, and code within the App belong to Code 82 Ltd. AI-generated content is provided for your personal, non-commercial use only. You may not reproduce or redistribute content generated by the App without written permission.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>LexisOne is provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù and ‚Äúas available‚Äù. We make no guarantees about uninterrupted access, accuracy, or completeness of any AI-generated content. To the maximum extent permitted by UK law, Code 82 Ltd shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from the use or inability to use the App, including reliance on AI outputs.</p>

    <h2>9. Age and Accessibility</h2>
    <p>LexisOne has no specific age restriction and is suitable for general use. Parents or guardians should supervise younger users where appropriate.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. The governing language of this agreement is English.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms occasionally. Any changes will be published within the App or on our website. Continued use of LexisOne after changes are posted means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
